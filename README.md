# Description

A small python script to create hw directories because I am lazy.

# Structure:

|-classes
|       |-Class Name(argument) 
|            |- hw#
|                 |- README.md
|                 |- given_material
|                 |- submission


# TODO

* make another folder for work
* add an flag to make it so you can set what language the hw is in.
then create a file template for it.
